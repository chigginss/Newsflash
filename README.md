# Newsflash

Newsflash displays the most popular news breaking right now in a D3.js visual. It organizes trending stories by the popularity and bias of the respective media outlet. Newsflash allows you to learn more about where your news comes from; users can observe how different bias may influence how news is reported. Additionally, users can search for trending coverage around a certain topic, and save these search terms. Newsflash visualizes data from NewsAPI, and combines this data with metrics from AllSides and Alexa's top 500 websites.
